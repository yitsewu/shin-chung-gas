## Features

- Bill details, consumption, costs and saved bill history.
- Scheduled queries, latest-bill queries, history backfill and statistics rebuilding.
- Last/next query times, query results and statistics status.
- Consumption and cost statistics for the Energy dashboard, without custom helpers or YAML.
- Multiple accounts and custom display names; failed queries preserve previously saved bills.

## Installation

Requires **Home Assistant 2026.9.1 or later**. 

**HACS**

1. Install HACS, then use the button above. Alternatively, add `https://github.com/yitsewu/shin-chung-gas` under HACS → Custom repositories and select **Integration**.
2. Download the integration and restart Home Assistant.

**ZIP installation**

1. Open [Releases](https://github.com/yitsewu/shin-chung-gas/releases). Download `scgas.zip` and extract its contents into `/config/custom_components/scgas/`, with `manifest.json` directly inside that directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

Back up HA before upgrading. 

## Account setup

1. Open **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** and search for **欣中天然氣**.
2. Enter the six-digit customer number and customer name printed on your bill. You can customize the display name. Initial import defaults to all bill periods available on the official website.
3. Adjust the query schedule in integration options. The default is **Monday at 09:00**, using your HA time zone.
4. Wait for long-term statistics to finish, then configure the Energy dashboard below.

## Add to the Energy dashboard

Wait until **Long-term statistics status** shows completed. Open **Energy → Edit dashboard → Gas → Add gas source**. Labels may vary with the HA language and version; the screenshots show the Traditional Chinese interface.

| ① Select consumption | ② Add costs |
| :--- | :--- |
| Select **欣中天然氣 總用氣量** (total gas consumption). Leave the flow-rate field empty. The display name is optional. | Select **Use an entity tracking the total costs**, then choose **欣中天然氣 總費用** (total cost) and save. |
| <a href="images/energy-gas-usage.png"><img src="images/energy-gas-usage.png" alt="Select total gas consumption and leave flow rate empty" width="300"></a> | <a href="images/energy-gas-cost.png"><img src="images/energy-gas-cost.png" alt="Select the integration total cost statistic" width="300"></a> |

Click an image to view it at full size. These screenshots show an existing source, so Save is disabled until a change is made. If you customized the account name, select the statistics with that name.

Return to **Energy → Gas** and select a month or year covered by your bills. A newly added source can take up to two hours to appear. The chart shows allocated bill consumption, not live meter readings.

## Automatic queries

| Purpose | Runs on | Schedule and scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import your bills | Home Assistant | Monday at 09:00 by default; configurable daily, weekly or monthly in the HA time zone. Updates the selected bill-history range. |
| Public compatibility check | GitHub Actions | Every six hours, at 02:41, 08:41, 14:41 and 20:41 Taiwan time; checks the latest stable release crawler and bill parser. It does not write to HA. |

Use integration options to change the schedule or the automatic-query switch to pause it. A monthly date beyond the end of the month runs on the last day. GitHub schedules may be delayed; the badge is independent of your home HA query status. See [check scope and status (Chinese)](live-check.md).

## Bill data

| Data | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bill period and consumption | Latest bill period, billed gas volume and available history |
| Charges and dates | Original total, charge details and dates supplied by the website |
| Payment status | Shown when provided; missing information remains unknown |
| Monthly and annual summaries | Allocated consumption, costs, optional carbon estimates and covered months; not necessarily a complete year |

Saved history is retained when the website stops listing an old bill. Backfill can refresh previously saved bills within the selected history range.

## Monthly allocation

New accounts default to equal allocation across the months covered by a bill. For example, **20 m³ and TWD 600 → 10 m³ and TWD 300 per month** for a two-month period.

This is **an estimate based on bill allocation, not actual monthly meter readings**. You can switch to allocation by billing-period days. Rebuild long-term statistics to recalculate saved bills without querying the website. 

Carbon estimates require a user-provided factor and source; otherwise they remain unknown.

## Troubleshooting

- **Query latest bill** refreshes the latest available bill.
- **Backfill history** retrieves or refreshes bills in the configured history range.
- **Rebuild long-term statistics** recalculates saved bills without contacting the website.
- Check query and verification status after a failure. Previously saved bills remain available after a failed query.
- If bills are available but the Energy dashboard has not updated, check long-term statistics status and wait for completion or rebuild statistics.

See the [full usage guide (Chinese)](usage.md) for options and detailed troubleshooting.

## Data source

Data comes from the [Shin Chung Gas bill-query website](https://www.scgas.com.tw:3001/MobileType_3_1). The integration uses your customer number and name to retrieve gas charges and meter-usage details, then organizes them into HA consumption, cost and historical statistics.
